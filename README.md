# CVE-2024-0204: Fortra GoAnywhere MFT Authentication Bypass Deep-Dive

This repository contains a proof-of-concept exploit for the authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-0204) discovered in Fortra's GoAnywhere MFT product. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to create an administrative user for the application.

# Description

On December 4, 2023, an internal security advisory was posted by Fortra, highlighting an authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-0204) in GoAnywhere MFT. The vulnerability enables an unauthenticated attacker to create an administrative user for the application. The discovery was credited to researchers malcolm0x and Islam Elrfai.

# Exploit Overview
The exploit involves manipulating the /..; path traversal technique to bypass the SecurityFilter class and gain unauthorized access to the /wizard/InitialAccountSetup.xhtml endpoint.

# Usage

```
python CVE-2024-0204.py --ip <TARGET_IP>
```
or
```
python CVE-2024-0204.py --targets <TARGETS_FILE_PATH>
```
+ Replace <TARGET_IP> with the specific target IP or URL you want to test.
+ Replace <TARGETS_FILE_PATH> with the path to a file containing a list of target IPs or URLs (one per line).

This will run the script to check if the specified targets are vulnerable to the CVE-2024-0204 GoAnywhere MFT authentication bypass. The script will attempt to create an administrative user and print the result for each target. If successful, it will provide the created admin user's details (username and password).
